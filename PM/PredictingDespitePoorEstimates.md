There have been many articles published that purport to explain why our software estimating skills are so poor, but I think they miss the point.  Here's what I think, in 5 parts.

## 1. The Five Orders of Ignorance

In the October, [2000 issue of the "Communications of the ACM"](https://www.la-acm.org/Archives/laacm0512-Article%2002%20The%205%20Orders%20of%20Ignorance%20OCT%202000.pdf), Philip G. Armour explains what's really going on in software estimation.
Here we go:

- **0th Order Ignorance - "Lack of Ignorance":**  this is when you know everything. Life is pretty good when you know everything. In software, we rarely write the same code over and over again, so we're not often in this position. However, we could be if we were doing a port to anoperating system that you've ported to before and therefore know everything.

- **1st Order Ignorance - "Lack of Knowledge":**  this one isn't so bad; it's when you realize that you don't know something. Your course of action is clear:  ask someone, do research, experiment, etc., until you do know the answer. If you are asked to give an estimate when you're in this state, you will naturally nclude time to do that research - don't skimp!

- **2nd Order Ignorance - "Lack of Awareness":**  this is when we start getting into trouble. We even realize that we don't know somethingn. These are the "unknown unknowns" that Donald Rumsfeld famously stated on February 12, 2002. We can't estimate them. We don't even know they exist. If your project management skills are limited to adding up all the estimates and using the total to predict when you'll be done, you're going to be in dire straights, because you just gave all those "unknown unknowns" an estimate of 0. And that will not go well.

-  **3rd Order Ignorance - "Lack of Process":**  in 2nd Order Ignorance, when you start building the software you start discovering all those things you didn't even know existed, but in 2rd Order Ignorance, that process fails. Typically you'll build software that no customer wants. But then they'll tell you, so you do find out eventually, assuming you're still in business.

-  **4th Order Ignorance - "Meta-Ignorance":**  How much worse can it get?  You have 4th Order Ignorance when you don't know about the Five Order of Ignorance. Now you do. And that presents an opportunity.  

The rest of this post will be about what to do about 2nd Order Ignorance. I'll have another post on how to fix 3rd Order Ignorance in the future.
