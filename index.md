Hi, I'm MiddleRaster, a retired software engineer, evidently slightly dyslexic.
Welcome to my pages.

I'll be discussing things I've learned in my 35-year career, 
including 4 completely original ideas. 

1. How to mock ***anything*** in C++: [Test Base Class Injection](https://github.com/MiddleRaster/tbci)
2. A C++ [technique](/honfd/HeaderOnlyNoForwardDeclarations.html) where circular dependencies are compiler errors
3. How to predict when a project will be done despite poor estimates
4. ***The*** metric for software development

Stay tuned for the rest.

Without further ado, here are my [test-driven development (TDD) tutorials](/TDD/tutorials.html).
