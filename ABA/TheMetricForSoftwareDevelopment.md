What do we want? High quality code.
When do we want it? As soon as possible.

How can we tell that we achieving both of these loft goals?

What we need is the perfect metric for software development.

1. Most people think such a thing doesn't exist.
2. Others think all metrics can be games and are therefore useless.
3. Finally, some think that the ultimate metric is how much money the business makes after producing the software.

Let me address the 3rd one first:  the only problem with this "ultimate" metric is that it's a *trailing metric*, that is, one that tells you after the fact whether you succeeded or not.

This isn't what we want:  we want a *leading metric* that will tell us in advance is we're on track to succeed, and if not, that will allow us to adjust our course as needed.

For #1 and #2, there is a lot of truth to these:  gameable metrics are worse than no metrics at all. 
In fact, that's the conclusion reached by the excellent book, [Measuring and Managing Performance in Organizations](https://www.amazon.com/Measuring-Managing-Performance-Organizations-Robert/dp/0932633366) by Robert D. Austin.
He also polls 20 "software industry luminaries" asking them their opinions, and most of them said there probably was one, but they didn't know what it was.

So gather 'round and I'll tell you the perfect metric. Of course, I can't just tell you, because you'll reject it out-of-hand. You've got to listen to the whole spiel.


## Metrics of a Good Codebase

Much as been written on this topic (e.g., the SOLID principles, the McCabe metrics, cyclomatic complexity metrics, etc.) and I think they all miss the point.
I define **a good codebase as one in which it's quick and easy to fix bugs**.

Think about that for a bit.
