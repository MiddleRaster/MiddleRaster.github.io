Welcome to the C++ Dojo. Here are a list of katas, easiest first:

1. [Prime Factors](PrimeFactors/Step1.html)
2. [Roman Numerals](RomanNumerals/Step1.html)
3. [Bowling Game](BowlingGame/BowlingGame.html)
4. the 8 Queens problem kata
5. Poker Hands kata

There are also some refactoring katas, to be added later:

1. Refactor the Bowling Game bonus logic class into a state-machine
2. The famous Gilded Rose refactoring kata
3. Clean up some truly awful MSDN sample code
4. Refactor an 8 Queens solution


Finally, here's a link to my header-only, completely portable, drop-in replacement for Visual Studio's native C++ unit testing framework:
