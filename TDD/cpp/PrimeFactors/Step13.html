We're writing just enough code to make all test cases up to 9 to pass.

As we increment our ```candidate``` variable, ```n``` gets smaller and smaller, so the terminating condition is when ```n``` is 1.  Like so:

```
static std::vector<int> Of(int n)
{
    std::vector<int> v;

    int candidate = 2;
    while (n > 1) {
        while (n % candidate == 0) {
            v.push_back(candidate);
            n /= candidate;
        }
        ++candidate;
    }

    if (n != 1)
        v.push_back(n);
    return v;
}
```
Now, look what we have:  we initialize a variable, loop until done, and increment. That's not a ```while``` loop:  that's a ```for``` loop.
Let's change that and then click [Next](Step14.html).
